End-to-end AI digital-human live-streaming platform: create a digital human (appearance +
voice + persona) → LivePortrait generates a base video → **Edge-TTS speech + Wav2Lip
lip-sync** → **DeepSeek LLM real-time replies** → SRS live streaming.

## Why

Traditional talking-head / live-streaming solutions either depend on expensive closed-source
APIs or require high-end GPUs and complex voice-cloning pipelines. LingCast aims for:

- Run LivePortrait preprocessing **only once** when creating a digital human; afterwards,
  broadcasts and live streams are lightweight inference (Edge-TTS + Wav2Lip ONNX) that work
  even without a GPU.
- Viewer app out of the box: guest/account identities, persisted chat, and **DeepSeek LLM**
  real-time replies that actually speak.
- Deployment friendly: Docker Compose boots the infrastructure with one command; the real AI
  Worker runs natively on the host (macOS MPS / Linux CUDA / AMD ROCm).

## Features

- [x] **Avatar Studio (create)**: persona name + preview + image upload + Edge-TTS voice picker
  (list cached in `localStorage`, default Chinese female voice Xiaoxiao), optional **persona
  profile** (age/height/weight/ethnicity/relationship status/personality). Shows
  "Generating base video…" after submit and polls the status.
- [x] **Digital human editing**: the "Edit" button on a card jumps to Avatar Studio
  (`?edit=<id>`) pre-filled; saving performs a PUT update (the appearance image is kept);
  deletion is confirmed via the system AlertDialog.
- [x] **Admin accounts**: after login you can change the display name and password in "Account
  settings" (persisted in the `admin_users` table, survives restarts).
- [x] **Broadcast (offline announcement)**: pick a ready digital human + enter a script →
  submit a task → poll → the result is embedded in the status card and played with
  **xgplayer** (9:16 portrait, up to 720×1080, modal playback).
- [x] **Client live room (viewer app)**: a standalone Next.js + TailwindCSS project
  (`frontend-user/`, port **3000**, separate from the admin console): the home page has a nav bar
  (guest/account identity, register/login/logout) and **category filtering**, listing all
  live bots (`GET /api/live`); `/rooms/:avatarId` plays HTTP-FLV via xgplayer, the chat panel
  shows `username #ID`, and messages can be sent directly to the digital human
  (`POST /api/live/:id/message`). `/api` and `/live` are proxied server-side by Next route
  handlers — no CORS burden in the browser.
- [x] **Douyin-style live room**: on desktop the left side is full-bleed video with a blurred
  background, a centered 9:16 video, and a fixed 400px chat panel on the right; on mobile the
  page goes fullscreen (nav hidden) with the back button and host avatar overlaid on the
  video, capsule messages + overlay input, and heart like animations; smart chat scrolling
  (scrolling up doesn't hijack auto-scroll; a "new messages" button appears).
- [x] **Chat identity & history persistence**: guests are auto-assigned a temp ID + username
  (`POST /api/chat/guest`); registering upgrades the current guest identity in place (chat
  history is preserved); logging in merges guest messages into the account; logging out
  issues a fresh guest identity. User messages and bot replies are all stored
  (`chat_users` / `chat_messages`); `GET /api/chat/history` serves history to both apps.
- [x] **Live subtitle settings**: each digital human can configure in Live Studio "Subtitle
  settings" whether subtitles are shown, the font (file name under `worker/fonts/`), position
  (top/bottom), stroke width, and font size; persisted as the Avatar's JSON field
  `live_settings`; the stream restarts automatically after saving.
- [x] **Admin user list**: sidebar "Users → User list" shows all chat users (guests/accounts
  + message counts), backed by `GET /api/users`.
- [x] **Light/dark themes**: the admin console defaults to dark (with a white logo variant);
  the viewer app nav bar can toggle light/dark and remembers the choice.
- [x] **Floating monitor**: a circular FAB at the bottom-right of Live Studio opens a draggable
  9:16 video overlay; the player is not rendered by default and is enabled on demand.
- [x] **LLM replies**: viewer messages → OpenAI Go SDK calls the DeepSeek Responses API
  (`base_url=https://api.deepseek.com`, model `deepseek-v4-flash`) → the reply is split into
  sentence chunks pushed to the live queue → TTS → lip-sync → stream. Without
  `OPENAI_API_KEY` the input is echoed back (test mode). The persona profile created at
  build time is injected as a **system prompt**, so questions about age/height/relationship
  status etc. are answered per the persona.
- [x] **Edge-TTS speech synthesis**: GPU-free cloud neural voices, selected by the avatar's
  `voice_id`; a sentence takes roughly 1-2s.
- [x] **LivePortrait base video preprocessing**: a silent 24fps driving video is generated
  once when creating a digital human.
- [x] **Wav2Lip (ONNX) lip-sync**: mouth frames matched to speech on top of the pre-generated
  base video; ONNX + CoreML executors, CPU threads capped (default 4); short base videos
  loop automatically to cover scripts of any length.
- [x] **Adjustable animation tempo**: swappable driving template and playback-speed / motion-
  amplitude knobs (see the `LIVEPORTRAIT_DRIVING*` parameters under Configuration).
- [x] **No-blinking base video**: the eye expression channels of the driving template are
  frozen (no blinking), keeping shoulder shrugs / subtle body motion roughly every 3s
  (`LIVEPORTRAIT_DRIVING_SPEED=0.2`).
- [x] **Digital human categories**: a category (chat/knowledge/entertainment/game/sales/other)
  can be picked when creating; the viewer home filters live streams by category.
- [x] **i18n (Chinese/English)**: the admin console and viewer app both ship Chinese and
  English UI with a language switcher (choice is persisted and the browser language is
  auto-detected); API error messages follow the request `Accept-Language` header; the
  live-room AI replies in the UI language.
- [x] **Face restoration (fixes Wav2Lip lip deformation)**: dual-track enhancer
  (`worker/ai/enhancer.py`) — GFPGANv1.4 ONNX restores only the face ROI with a feathered
  mask in the live pipeline, CodeFormer ONNX (fidelity `w=0.6`) restores full-face detail
  offline. ONNX-only inference (CoreML/CUDA/ROCm); offline is on by default, live
  never applies restoration (the watchdog writer must sustain 24fps; GFPGAN is
  ~1s/frame on Apple Silicon CoreML). Offline quality validated with before/after
  comparison videos (see below).
- [x] **Watchdog live pipeline (no more buffering)**: a dedicated writer thread
  pushes exactly 24fps to ffmpeg, consuming a ready-frames queue; when Wav2Lip is
  still producing, it instantly falls back to the base animation + silent audio,
  so the player never drops or buffers ("转圈"). Inference runs async in small
  Wav2Lip batches, splicing consecutive sentences seamlessly.
- [x] **Private knowledge base + long-term memory (local RAG, zero model)**:
  two-level model avatar → knowledge collection → documents. A dedicated
  `rag-service` microservice (FastAPI + uv + [zvec](https://zvec.org) in-process
  full-text search) segments Chinese with its bundled Jieba tokenizer — no
  sentence-transformers / torch / model downloads, and no RediSearch. Documents
  (paste text or upload .txt/.pdf) are chunked (~300 chars / 50 overlap) and
  indexed per collection; the live chat endpoint injects the last 10 room
  messages plus Top-3 chunks (strictly scoped by avatar) into the LLM prompt.
- [x] **Knowledge management UI**: `/knowledge` lists collections (create /
  rename / delete) and `/knowledge/$id` manages the documents inside a
  collection (add text / upload .txt/.pdf / delete) with a Top-3 retrieval test
  scoped to that collection.
- [x] **Edge-TTS microservice** (`tts-service/`, internal :8002): async
  `edge_tts.Communicate` → ffmpeg → **16 kHz / 16-bit / mono PCM WAV** (the exact
  format Wav2Lip requires) → upload to S3 (RustFS) → returns only the S3 object
  key + metadata; temp files are removed in `finally`, S3 config comes from env.
- [x] **Chat log page**: `/chat-logs` filters by avatar, user ID, date and
  keyword with pagination; bot replies are tagged "knowledge hit" and the exact
  retrieved chunks can be expanded.
- [x] **Audience account center**: `/account` shows the viewer identity
  (guest/account), register / login / logout, and "my messages" across rooms;
  the home page got a hero CTA, card hover overlays and a footer account link.
- [ ] **Mock pipeline** (`AI_MODE=mock`): lightweight placeholder for Docker Worker image demos.

- Admin frontend: React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind + shadcn/ui (brand "LingCast", dark
  theme by default, switchable to light; requires admin login).
- Viewer frontend: standalone Next.js 16 + TailwindCSS 4 (`frontend-user/`, light/dark themes,
  no login required).
- Backend: Go + Gin + GORM split into three microservices sharing one module —
  `api-admin` (management console, :8081), `api-user` (audience/live chat,
  :8082) and `api-scheduler` (worker webhooks, :8083); standard AWS S3 SDK v2.
- AI Worker: Python 3.11, uv-managed dependencies, boto3 + Redis.
- Knowledge microservice: `rag-service` (FastAPI + uv + zvec FTS, Jieba tokenizer,
  zero model dependencies, internal :8001, data persisted in the `rag-zvec-data` volume).
- Storage: S3-compatible object storage (RustFS in dev).
- Deployment: Docker Compose orchestrates the infrastructure and frontends; **the real AI
  Worker runs natively on the host** (MPS/CoreML on macOS Apple Silicon, NVIDIA CUDA or AMD
  ROCm on Linux). Host-published ports are limited to what the host worker and
  the web apps need: **3000** (viewer), **8080** (admin/API), **1935** (RTMP ingest),
  **6379** (Redis) and **9000** (RustFS). `api-admin`, `api-user`,
  `api-scheduler`, `rag-service` and `tts-service` stay on the internal network.

## Quick Start

### 0. Prerequisites

- Git, Docker Desktop (or Docker Engine + Compose)
- Python 3.11 + [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
- FFmpeg on a macOS host: `brew install ffmpeg`
- pnpm 10 for frontend development: `npm i -g pnpm@10`
- Go 1.22+ for backend development

### 1. Clone & start the Docker services

```bash
git clone https://github.com/taochangle/LingCast.git && cd LingCast
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up --build
```

Open <http://localhost:8080> and enter **Avatar Studio** from the left menu.

> **Note**: the admin console requires login (default `admin` / `admin123`; change
> `ADMIN_USERNAME` / `ADMIN_PASSWORD` in `.env` and restart the API container). The viewer
> app (:3000) is unaffected and can enter live rooms directly.

### 2. Set up the Worker environment (uv)

```bash
cd worker
uv venv                    # uses CPython 3.11 per .python-version
uv sync --all-groups       # installs all deps (PyTorch MPS, LivePortrait, Wav2Lip)
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

> Convention: every Python command goes through `uv run python ...` (run from `worker/`).
> Don't call the system `python`/`python3` directly and don't use `requirements.txt` —
> dependencies are managed by `pyproject.toml` + `uv.lock`; add new deps with `uv add`.

### 3. Prepare the models (pick one)

**Option A: download on a new machine (~4GB, requires network)**

```bash
cd worker
uv run python download_models.py --models all
```

The script clones LivePortrait / Wav2Lip into `worker/external/`, downloads weights into
`worker/models/` (both are gitignored), and automatically exports `wav2lip_gan.pth` to ONNX
locally (~145MB) and downloads the SCRFD face-detection ONNX (~3MB).

- Faster downloads in China: `HF_ENDPOINT=https://hf-mirror.com uv run python download_models.py`
- If GitHub is slow, use a proxy: `git config --global http.proxy http://127.0.0.1:7897`

**Option B: copy from an old machine (fastest)**

Copy `worker/models/` and `worker/external/` from the old machine to the corresponding
locations on the new one; `download_models.py` skips files that already exist.

### 4. Start the Worker (real pipeline)

```bash
cd worker
uv run python -u worker.py           # offline broadcast / create preprocessing
uv run python -u stream_worker.py    # live streaming (runs alongside worker.py)
```

`worker.py` loads `worker/.env.local` automatically (exported environment variables take
precedence). `AI_MODE=real` runs the real model pipeline; missing models produce a clear
error message.

### 5. Local frontend development

```bash
# Admin console (Vite, port 5173)
cd frontend-admin
cp .env.example .env.local   # VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080
pnpm install
pnpm dev

# Viewer app (Next.js, port 3000)
cd frontend-user
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

### Linux + AMD Radeon deployment (ROCm, e.g. RX 6800 XT)

The 6800 XT is RDNA2 (gfx1030), supported by ROCm 6.x / 7.x. Either way works:

**Option A: official ROCm PyTorch container (recommended, torch preinstalled)**

```bash
docker run -it --rm --network=host --ipc=host \
  --device=/dev/kfd --device=/dev/dri --group-add video \
  -v /path/to/LingCast:/workspace -w /workspace/worker \
  rocm/pytorch:rocm7.14_ubuntu24.04_py3.13_pytorch_release_2.12.0 bash
```

Inside the container (Python 3.13, torch 2.12 ROCm ready):

```bash
pip install uv ffmpeg        # containers usually lack uv and ffmpeg
uv sync --all-groups --no-group cuda --python python3 --inexact
cp .env.local.example .env.local
uv run python -u worker.py
```

> **Warning**: `--inexact` matters — the preinstalled torch is not in the lock file; without
> it `uv sync` removes torch. `--network=host` lets the container reach Redis/RustFS on the
> host directly.

**Option B: bare-metal Ubuntu + ROCm**

```bash
cd worker
uv sync --all-groups --no-group cuda
uv pip install torch torchvision torchaudio \
  --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/rocm6.3
# add --inexact to every future uv sync, otherwise the manually installed torch is removed
```

Verify: `uv run python -c "import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available(), torch.version.hip)"`

**Worker environment variables (`worker/.env.local`)**

```bash
AI_MODE=real
LIVEPORTRAIT_DEVICE=cuda
WAV2LIP_PROVIDER=rocm    # falls back to CPU per operator when ROCm EP lacks LSTM; correct output
```

> If the ROCm EP has issues on your card, `WAV2LIP_PROVIDER=cpu` works too (CPU inference
> alone reaches 35fps+).

## Usage

### Create a digital human

Admin console → **Avatar Studio**: upload an appearance image, pick a voice and category,
fill in the persona profile → creation automatically starts base-video generation
(LivePortrait preprocessing, ~1-2 minutes); once ready, the digital human can be used for
broadcasts and live streaming.

### Offline broadcast

**Broadcast**: pick a digital human + enter a script → submit a task → track progress in the
history and play/download the result (9:16 MP4, Edge-TTS + Wav2Lip).

### Live streaming

**Live Studio**: after starting a live stream the digital human pushes a persistent stream
(idle state plays the base animation); the studio can send test messages, while viewer
messages go through the **DeepSeek LLM** and are spoken aloud. Subtitles can be configured
per digital human in "Subtitle settings" (on/off, font, position, border, size; fonts live
in `worker/fonts/`).

```bash
# command-line examples
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/live/9/start
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/live/9/message \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"text": "Hello, are you there?"}'
curl http://localhost:8080/api/live/9/status
```

Playback URL: `http://localhost:8080/live/avatar_9.flv` (the frontend pulls it with
xgplayer + the FLV plugin).

### Viewer app

Open <http://localhost:3000>: filter live digital humans by category on the home page →
enter a live room (desktop left/right layout / mobile fullscreen Douyin style) → guests can
send messages directly; after registering/logging in, chat history follows the account.

speed / amplitude) is documented in the `LIVEPORTRAIT_DRIVING*` comments and
`worker/.env.local.example`.

## API Docs

All HTTP microservices expose interactive OpenAPI/Swagger docs through a
dedicated `docs` gateway (nginx entry `http://localhost:8080/doc/`):

- `/doc/api-admin/` — admin console API (gin-swagger)
- `/doc/api-user/` — viewer / live-chat API (gin-swagger)
- `/doc/api-scheduler/` — worker webhooks (gin-swagger)
- `/doc/rag-service/` — knowledge-base service (FastAPI /docs)
- `/doc/tts-service/` — TTS service (FastAPI /docs)

## FAQ

- **Task stuck on processing**: check the tail of the `worker` logs. A stuck lip-sync phase
  usually means missing models — run
  `cd worker && uv run python download_models.py --models wav2lip` to fill the gap.
- **Slow GitHub/HF downloads**: use a proxy for GitHub, and
  `HF_ENDPOINT=https://hf-mirror.com` for HuggingFace.
- **Lip-sync pegs the CPU / is extremely slow**: make sure `WAV2LIP_BACKEND` is `onnx` (the
  torch backend is for comparison only).
- **Video has no audio**: the final video muxes Edge-TTS audio during the Wav2Lip stage; with
  the mock pipeline the offline TTS provides the audio track instead.
- **Live stream shows no picture**: first confirm `srs` is healthy in `docker compose up` and
  that `/live/<id>.flv` can be pulled; the ffmpeg log is at `stream-<id>/ffmpeg.log`.

## Production Notes

- The dev environment runs RustFS with the bucket publicly readable (so the
  browser can play videos). In production, switch to real RustFS + a private bucket +
  presigned URLs, and adjust `S3_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` and the nginx `/media` proxy.
- Harden the Worker callback Webhook authentication in production.
- Linux/CUDA production deployments need the CUDA build of PyTorch (see the comments in
  `worker/pyproject.toml`); Wav2Lip ONNX can use a GPU provider on NVIDIA via
  `WAV2LIP_PROVIDER`.
